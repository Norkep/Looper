# Looper

Looper is a sketch plugin that helps automate duplication of groups and layers. One can control properties like Rotate, Scale and Opacity while duplicating. This powerful combination enables artists and designers to create interesting geometric and organic patterns.

## Loop `âŒ˜ + L`

### Duplication count
Duplicate selected group or layer by providing the duplication count or Looper can automatically calculate the count based on the rotation angle to form a complete circle.

### Rotate
Rotate selected group or layer by providing a specific rotation angle or Looper can automatically calculate the angle required based on the duplication count to form a complete circle.

Rotation angle can be incremented in a linear fashion, randomly or can be set to increment sinusoidally.

### Opacity
Opacity of selected group or layer can be set to update at random, increase from 0 to 100 or decrease from 100 to 0.

### Move
Selected group or layer can be moved Horizontally, Vertically and Diagonally with a set increment value. Duplicated items can also be distributed randomly within a given dimension (width & height)

### Scale
Selected group or layer can be scaled by absolute value (px), proportional value (%) or at random.
